About
-------------------

Carson is a very simple continuous integration and build management system. It
allows you write simple Lua scripts that will be executed when a trigger is
satisfied (also scripted in Lua) or when a user manually triggers them through
the web-based interface.

Scripting
-------------------

All of the functions from the Lua 5.2 standard libraries are available in build
scripts. Some additional functions are listed below:

_LAST_TIME_RUN
	The last time the project was run (stored as a timestamp compatible with
	os.date and os.difftime).

os.chdir(directory)
	Changes the working directory.

os.capture(command)
	This function is equivalent to the os.execute function, except that the
	result is returned as a string instead of output to the standard output.

Schedule Module
-------------------

schedule.daily(time)
	Sets the exit code based on whether or not the specified time of the day
	has passed since the last build.
	Example:
		require('modules/schedule')
		schedule.daily("12:00 AM") -- run at 12:00 AM once per day

schedule.periodic(minutes)
	Sets the exit code so that the project will be run at the specified
	interval.
	Example:
		require('modules/schedule')
		schedule.periodic(10) -- run every 10 minutes
